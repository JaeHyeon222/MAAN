# MAAN

## The Environments

The evaluation environments adopted by us is recorded in the `requirements.txt`. After you built your own basic Python (Python = 3.9 in our setting) setup via either *virtual environment* or *anaconda*, please try to keep similar to it via:

- Step1: install Pytorch first:
`pip install torch==1.13.1+cu117 torchvision==0.14.1+cu117 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117`

- Step2: install other libs via:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

or take it as a reference based on your original environments.
